    "In the Convolutional SNNs (henceforth just SNNs here), MaxPooling isn't as trivial as the regular $max(.)$ operation. What will you take $max(.)$ of? binary spikes? Will it be optimal? A few methods of MaxPooling in SNNs exist (more details in the paper linked above), but **none** of them have been evaluated on Loihi - in the context of MaxPooling in SNNs. Therefore, we designed two neurmorphic-hardware friendly methods of spiking-MaxPooling in SNNs, and evaluated their efficacy with a number of Image Classification experiments on MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR10 datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the absence of such neuromorphic-hardware friendly spiking-MaxPooling methods, a lot of `on-chip` - `off-chip` inter-communication will happen upon the deployment of SNNs with MaxPooling layers on a neuromorphic hardware. This is due to the fact that the `Conv` layers with neurons get deployed `on-chip` and `MaxPooling` layers with no neurons get deployed `off-chip`. Such unsought inter-communication not only defeats the energy-efficiency motive of deploying SNNs on a neuromorphic hardware, but also results in spike-communication latency.\n",

    "# Methods of spiking-MaxPooling\n",
    "\n",
    "I now present the theory and PoC demonstration of our proposed methods of spiking-MaxPooling, namely: **MJOP** and **AVAM**. Both of these methods rely on the representation of the artificial neuron `activations` as `currents` in the SNNs, obtained after filtering the spikes from the spiking neurons. Let's consider the case of $2\\times2$ MaxPooling, where for one such pooling window, we need to find the $max(U_1, U_2, U_3, U_4)$ where $U_i$s are the input current values. I used [NengoLoihi](https://www.nengo.ai/nengo-loihi/) backend to deploy both these methods - **MJOP** and **AVAM** on the Loihi neuromorphic hardware. For the benchmark purpose, I obtained the `True Max U` = $max(U_1, U_2, U_3, U_4)$ from a different network run on CPU, and compared the outputs of the **MJOP** and **AVAM** methods with `True Max U`. The evaluation criteria is to visually check if the **MJOP** and **AVAM** outputs closely match the $max(.)$ output!\n",

    "The **MJOP** method of spiking-MaxPooling is a Loihi **dependent** method, as it uses the NxCore APIs and the Multi-Compartment (MC) neuron properties of Loihi. Note the subtle difference between \"compartments\" and \"neurons\"; a Loihi neuron can have one or more spiking units (called compartments) in it. MJOP method is loosely based on the simple observation that:\n",

    "In a MC neuron, the Single-Compartment (SC) units are connected in a binary tree fashion, and can communicate the received $U_i$ to their parent compartment. Note that each compartment in a MC neuron can be stimulated by an external input $U_i$. Therefore, considering the case of a two compartment neuron i.e. the parent compartment has only one kid, where both the compartments receive currents $U_1$ and $U_2$ respectively, the parent compartment has to act on the current $U_2$ from its kid. It does so by executing one of the many `join` operations provided by the low-level Loihi APIs. These `join` Ops can be `MIN`, `ADD`, `MAX`, etc.. And as you might have guessed by now, we used the `MAX` `join`-Op and the MC neuron creation functionality in Loihi to realize spiking-MaxPooling in SNNs - as shown in the figure below (for a $2\\times2$ MaxPooling window).\n",

    "The topmost root neuron receives a running $max(.)$ of all the input currents, and then it spikes at a rate corresponding to the maximum computed current $U_{max}$. Since it outputs spikes (and not the maximum current) at a rate directly proportional to the maximum input current $U_{max}$, we need to _**scale**_ the filtered output spikes to match it to the true maximum current. Had the root neuron been able to communicate current to the next connected neuron on Loihi, outputting a simple $max(.)$ of currents would have been possible; but this is not the case here. Note that, the required number of compartments in the MC neuron is same as the number of elements in the MaxPooling window. Also note that the value of _**scale**_ depends on a number of factors, e.g. the root neuron's configuration and the maximum input current to the root neuron. More details on how to choose the _**scale**_ value are in our paper.\n",

    "Since NengoLoihi uses the NxCore APIs (and not the NxNet APIs), I had to use the low level NxCore APIs to configure the `Ensemble` of neurons to a MC neuron on the Loihi hardware. In short, for a $2\\times2$ MaxPooling, you need to create an `Ensemble` $4$ neurons, then access the NengoLoihi object mapping the `Ensemble` to the Loihi board, and then configure the individual neurons (now considered as \"compartments\" on the Loihi board) to create a MC neuron with `MAX` join-Op between the compartments.

    "As can be seen from the above PoC output plots for both the methods, the **MJOP** Net's scaled output closely matches the `True Max U` output. In case of the **AVAM** Net too, the outputs for different `radius` values closely matches the `True Max U` output; this implicity shows the robustness of the **AVAM** Net w.r.t. the `radius` values. In the spirit of pooling methods, I also compared the AveragePooling output with that of the **MJOP** and **AVAM** Nets; as it can be seen, **MJOP** and **AVAM** outputs are higher than the AveragePooled output."

    "More details on how to adapt the **MJOP** and **AVAM** methods of spiking-MaxPooling in your SNNs can be found in our paper. I have evaluated **MJOP** and **AVAM** on Loihi-1 only, so it will be interesting to see how these methods fare on Loihi-2. I hope this PoC article helped you understand the crux of our paper. Please feel free to post your questions (if any) below! "
